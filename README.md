## Authentication

- **octoreport** uses GitHub OAuth Device Flow for secure authentication.
- Tokens are stored securely using keytar (OS-native credential storage).
- No need to manually create or manage PATs.
- Supports multiple accounts.

## Timezone Handling

- All date inputs are interpreted in your local timezone (auto-detected).
- Dates are converted to UTC ISO 8601 before querying the GitHub API, ensuring accurate results regardless of your location.
- Powered by luxon.

## Configuration

- User configuration (e.g., GitHub username, email address) is stored in `~/.octoreport/`.
- Tokens are never stored in plain text.
